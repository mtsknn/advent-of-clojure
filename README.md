# Advent of Clojure

**[Advent of Code 2021](https://adventofcode.com/2021) solutions in Clojure.**

I don't really know what I'm doing
(I'm not proficient in Clojure),
so don't try to learn from my solutions. ðŸ˜ƒ

[Puzzle instructions available at Advent of Code.](https://adventofcode.com/)
Each puzzle has two parts.
Part 2 is unlocked after solving Part 1.

## Solutions

The files are meant to be evaluated in a REPL a small piece at a time.
Running a full file probably won't work.

## Wanna mentor me?

If you know Clojure and don't have anything better to do (heh),
feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/mtsknn/advent-of-clojure/issues)
and let me know how I could improve my code or make it more idiomatic.
Thanks!
